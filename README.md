# Developing Data Products: Course Project
## D3 and Shiny App for Data Visualization

## About
This Shiny Web Application, is about temperature variation record analysis from last 10 years.
I have taken the data for every 31<sup>st</sup> January from 2006 to 2015 for my City. There is some variation recorded and i have used it to plot a histogram by using Shiny and D3 framework.

It's just to know, how is the temperature varies every year on same date. To do this, i have separated my code in some parts:

  1. data in simple ```".csv"``` format,
  2. ```server.R``` for some reactive output display as a result of server calculations,
  3. ```ui.R``` for the user-interface definitions,
  4. ```d3-shiny-app.html``` as a partial markup page, where i have written all the D3 logic to do data visualization.
