## About
> D3 and Shiny App for Data Visualization.

This Shiny Web Application, is about temperature variation record analysis from last 10 years.
I have taken the data for every 31<sup>st</sup> January from 2006 to 2015 for my City. There is some variation recorded and i have used it to plot a histogram by using Shiny and D3 framework.

It's just to know, how is the temperature varies every year on same date. To do this, i have separated my code in some parts:

  1. data in simple ```".csv"``` format,
  2. ```server.R``` for some reactive output display as a result of server calculations,
  3. ```ui.R``` for the user-interface definitions,
  4. ```d3-shiny-app.html``` as a partial markup page, where i have written all the D3 logic to do data visualization.
  
## Working Principle

[A] This is the server logic for a Shiny Web Application:

  1. First, data is taken by ```server.R``` in ```"data.csv"``` format,
  2. Then, reactive expressions is used to get the data and translate relative paths to server-friendly paths,
  3. When, in-case of data changes, again it update the bar plot.
  
  ```{r}
  library(shiny)
  ```
  ```{r}
  shinyServer(function(input, output) {
  data <- reactive({
    
    if (input$dataSource == FALSE){
      path <- input$url
      if (substr(input$url, 0, 2) == "./"){
        path <- paste("./www/", substring(input$url, 3), sep="")
      }
    } else {
      df <- input$file
      path <- df$datapath
    }
    
    data <- read.csv(path, row.names=1)
    data.df <- cbind(rownames(data), data)
    colnames(data.df)[1] <- "Date"
    data.df
  })
    output$perfbarplot <- reactive({
      data()
    })
  })
  ```
